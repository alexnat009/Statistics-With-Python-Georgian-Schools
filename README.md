# Statistics-With-Python-Georgian-Schools
Statistical analysis and regression modeling using Python, with a focus on educational infrastructure and budgets of Georgian schools. This repository demonstrates practical implementations of statistical theories for real-world applications.

# Research Thesis: Statistical Analysis and Application with Python

## Overview
This research explores the application of statistical methods and functions in Python, using Georgian school data as a real-world example. The focus lies on analyzing school utility bills, teacher salaries, and infrastructure conditions to uncover trends, optimize resources, and propose improvements.

Key objectives include:
- Understanding statistical methodologies such as regression, distribution, deviation, and others.
- Implementing these methods in Python to solve practical problems.
- Providing a computational framework for students and professionals interested in data modeling and prediction.
